<h1>Why we should we protect trees?</h1>


<h3>Trees are vital. As the biggest plants on the planet, they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world’s wildlife.

</h3>
<h3>
    They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter.
    
    Not only are trees essential for life, but as the longest living species on earth, they give us a link between the past, present and future.
    
    It’s critical that woodlands, rainforests and trees in urban settings, such as parks, are preserved and sustainably managed across the world
    
    The canopies of trees act as a physical filter, trapping dust and absorbing pollutants from the air. Each individual tree removes up to 1.7 kilos every year. They also provide shade from solar radiation and reduce noise.
    
    Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow and the carbon that they store in their wood helps slow the rate of global warming.They reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves. It’s estimated that trees can reduce the temperature in a city by up to 7°C.Trees also help prevent flooding and soil erosion, absorbing thousands of litres of stormwater.

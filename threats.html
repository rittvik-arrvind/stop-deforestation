   <h2> Deforestation occurs when forest land is cleared, usually to harvest the timber or clear space for agricultural operations. More than 25 percent of the land on Earth is covered by forests, but millions of hectares of this ecosystem are destroyed every year, according to the University of Michigan. Over half of the worldâ€™s forests are found in just seven countries: Brazil, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Russia, and the United States. Therefore, while the disadvantages of deforestation are global, the decision to clear forest land belongs to only a handful of governments.
The disadvantages to deforestation are an increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions and soil erosion as well as the destruction of forest habitat and the loss of biological diversity of both plants and animals. </h2>
